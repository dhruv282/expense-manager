# gsheet_pg_migration_tool.py

This script migrates expense data in Google Sheets to the Postgres table used for this application. 
This tool is to assist with the migration from [expense-tracker](https://github.com/dhruv282/expense-tracker).
Use the [`config.toml`](./config.toml) to add the credentials for your own Google Sheet.
